In this workout, we created a shiny app to visualize the Savings Simulation exercise we created in warmup06. In warmup06 we hardcoded functions to calculate the effects of savings from return rates, growth, contributions, initial amount, etc. In this workout, we made this reactive in Shiny App meaning that the user can change the various variables and see the effects in real time on both a plot and a data table.
